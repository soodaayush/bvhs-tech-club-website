## Inspiration

As the club president, I wanted to create more than just another school webpage. This site is a hub for everything Tech Club, from who we are to the challenges we pose and the creativity we celebrate. It's a space where students can explore, learn, and get inspired.

## Challenges

Building a site that looks great on every screen, including phones, tablets, desktops, while still being fun and easy to navigate wasn't easy. The real challenge? Balancing design with performance and accessibility.

## Lessons Learned

This project introduced me to the magic of Vanta.js, a library that lets you add interactive, animated backgrounds to your site. It helped take the design to the next level, sleek, techy, and just a bit playful.

## The Website

Dive in and learn more about the Tech Club, what we do, how to join, and the binary puzzle that students unlock by scanning a mysterious QR code.
